things-to-do:

I have a 'requests' directory open in a code editor. 
re-organize files in regards to 'requests' directory.

<food-for-thought> I can automate these tasks later.

A bunch of directorys are labeled as 'vue-create-app' or as a 
similar variant, which could all be organized.

<app-ideas>

I wish to keep track of all the time that i spend taking a break. 
Can this be made with python.
