I need to create some kind of work-flow system

ideas:
note-taking system-
possibly write a software? that is hosted on VPS, and 
from my phone I can post notes onto a database / 
or file so that it makes my github commits easier to
work with if they were only text--based commits.

from phone -- ((write a message)) -> client pushes content to
a pipeline that ultimately adds an entry to a database / or
file ->  before-then, .. within the pipeline .. a server is
asked to receive a request, ..and once accepted.. the server
processes content and or the data .. to add to a database /
or file -> from there, server .. continues to run .. and
process the next set of actions which is to check the git status,
git add -A, and commit. Ultimately pushing the commit onto the
remote repo.
